# Calories-Burnt-Prediction
The Calories Burnt Prediction project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms in estimating the number of calories burned based on physiological and exercise-related inputs such as age, gender, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.

ðŸ”§ System Approach: Calories Burned Prediction
Data Collection:

Load a dataset containing biometric and activity-related features (e.g., age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, body temperature, activity duration, etc.).

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (if any)

Convert categorical features into numerical (e.g., gender)

Normalize or standardize feature values for consistent scaling

Feature selection or extraction if needed

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand distribution of features

Correlation analysis to understand feature relevance with target variable (calories burned)

Visualization using plots and graphs

Model Building:

Split dataset into training and testing sets

Train various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc.)

Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score

Model Evaluation & Selection:

Compare performance of different algorithms

Select the best-performing model for final deployment

Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict calories burned for new input data
